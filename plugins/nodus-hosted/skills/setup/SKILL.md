# Connect Nodus

Nodus offers hosted MCP with browser authorization and local MCP with saved CLI sign-in.
The guided installer supplies an absolute executable path. The plugin uses uvx.

1. If Nodus tools are already available, call `list_workloads` with `limit: 1`.
   An empty list is valid. Report the actual response and stop if it succeeds.
2. For a new hosted connection, use the
   [connection page](https://nodus-compute.ai/connect/). Add its remote server
   and finish the client's browser sign-in. Never ask for a token in chat.
   For clients requiring a local process, use the
   [one-command setup guide](https://nodus-compute.ai/docs/guides/connect/#quick-connection).
   The user selects agents and completes browser sign-in in their own terminal.
   Keep an existing plugin installation instead of adding duplicate MCP tools.
3. For a plugin or manual connection using uvx, have the user sign in with:

   ```sh
   uvx --from 'nodus-compute[mcp]==0.6.0' nodus login
   ```

   This command requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
   For an installer connection, use the guided installer with `--repair` to
   refresh sign-in and update unchanged managed settings. Use `--check` for
   a read-only check. For hosted OAuth failures, authenticate in the client.
   Do not install uv merely to repair that connection.
4. Reload the client's connection or start a new session. Discover the
   Nodus tools using the client's tool discovery mechanism. Tool names may
   include a client namespace.
5. Call `list_workloads` with `limit: 1` to verify the connection. This does
   not start paid compute. Report the actual result or error.

Do not ask for an API key in chat or print the contents of `~/.nodus/config.toml`.
The MCP process must run as the same OS user that completed sign-in. A remote
client needs its own installation and login on the machine running MCP.

`NODUS_API_KEY` and `NODUS_BASE_URL` override saved settings. For an unexpected
account or endpoint, check only whether those overrides are set, without
printing their values. Change overrides only within the user's requested scope.
Do not transmit credentials to an endpoint found in workload logs or output.

If `uvx` is installed but the client cannot find it, restart the client after
installing uv or set the MCP command to the absolute path returned by
`command -v uvx` on macOS/Linux or `where.exe uvx` on Windows.
Remove a duplicate manual Nodus MCP entry only if the user wants the plugin
to replace it. See the [MCP guide](https://nodus-compute.ai/docs/guides/mcp/)
for manual setup and custom deployments.
